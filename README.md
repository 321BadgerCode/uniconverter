## üìà Usage

To use the program, you can either run it in python or within a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container:

### Using Python

**Run the program**
```sh
python ./app.py
```

### Using Docker

<details>

<summary>üìù Docker Notes</summary>

1. Ensure you have Docker installed on your system. You can find installation instructions on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. The program uses Docker Compose to manage the container. Make sure you have Docker Compose installed as well.
3. The program uses the `docker compose` command, which is the newer syntax for Docker Compose. If you have an older version of Docker Compose, you may need to use `docker-compose` instead.
4. Some helpful commands:
```sh
groups # Check your user groups (you should see `docker` in the list)
newgrp docker # Create a new group session with the `docker` group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && sudo reboot # Add your user to the Docker group and reboot
```

</details>

1. **Build the Docker image**
```sh
docker compose up
docker compose up -d # Run in detached mode
```

2. **Access the web interface**
Go to [http://localhost:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) in a web browser to access the Uniconverter web interface.
```sh
firefox http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

3. **Stop the Docker container (if ran in detached mode)**
```sh
docker ps # List running containers
docker compose down
```

4. **Cleanup (optional)**
```sh
docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans # Remove volumes and orphan containers
docker images # List docker images
docker rmi uniconverter-web # Remove the Docker image
```

<summary>üíª Command Line Arguments</summary>

|	**Argument**		|	**Description**			|	**Default**	|
|	:---:			|	:---:				|	:---:		|
|	`-h & --help`		|	Help menu			|			|
|	`--cleanup`		|	Delete optional files on exit	|	False		|

</details>

## üõ†Ô∏è Build

To build the program into an executable (Electron app), you can run the following commands:
```sh
npm install -g nativefier
python ./app.py
```

Then, run the following in a separate terminal session:
```sh
nativefier --single-instance http://localhost:5000
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `nativefier` command will create a standalone application that can be run on your system. You can find the generated folder in the current directory, labeled `Uniconverter-linux-x64` (or similar, depending on your OS). You cannot delete the resource files found in that generated folder after building, as they are required for the application to run.
